				<a data-lightbox-gallery="portfolio-gallery"><img src="static/images/fruits.jpg" alt="portfolio img"></a><h2 style="color: black">Worried about your Left fruits?</h2> <p style="text-align: left;">There are seven commonly used methods of managing fruit and vegetable waste. The list of methods provided here will define the method of management, list some pros and cons of that method, and discuss operational details. This list cannot be easily arranged in order of best management practice from an environmental standpoint due to individual situations of the farmer and packing house where culls originate. The management options are provided as a means to help better explain how each may be used.<br>

                    The following list of management methods provides a protocol for managing waste<br>
                   <b> 1)Store the culled fruit and vegetables on-site<br></b>
                    Storing culled fruit and vegetable waste on-site is a temporary solution to final disposal or reuse of materials. To use this method, the culls may be hauled or transferred via mechanical methods to a location that has been prepared for holding the culls. At a minimum, the holding area should be to capture and hold rainfall and any liquids that have formed from the decomposition of the culled fruit and vegetables. Other options for such a site include storage in tanks or bunkers with easy access for removing liquids or solids for later management. The culls stored in the bermed area should be crushed, if possible, to allow the available liquid to better evaporate. Crushing the culled fruit and vegetables and placing them in a bermed area helps control the leachate, run-on, and runoff makes managing the material easier, allows extra liquids to evaporate, and reduces the volume that will need to be managed at a later time.<br>
                     
                   <b>2)Return fruit and vegetable waste to the field<br></b>
                    From agricultural nutrient management and organic building viewpoint, returning fruit and vegetable waste to the field may be one of the better options. This management method returns the culls back to the growing field where the nutrients can be recycled, allowing the fruit and vegetable pulp and juice to help build or maintain the soil organic matter content. The cost can be very low based on the distance to the field and the amount of liquid removed. The protocol for transporting the culls to a growing field will consist of storing the culls at the packing house or at the field site until the final harvest of the crop. After the final harvest, the culls or remaining solids and liquids can be loaded into spreader trucks and applied evenly across the field. As a matter of practice, the material should be incorporated, which will reduce the potential for problematic odors and runoff.<br>
                     
                    <b>3)Feed fruit and vegetable waste to livestock</b><br>
                    Managing culls by feeding fruit and vegetable waste to livestock may be a good option based on the overall management system of the livestock operation. One of the major issues that must be addressed involves the nutritional benefits and effects of feeding culls to livestock. Farmers should consult with animal scientists or veterinarians to confirm the effects of feeding culls to livestock. If the nutritional aspect of feeding fruit and vegetable waste to livestock met.<br>
                     
                    <b>4)Give good fruit and vegetable culls to local food banks</b><br>
                    
                    Food banks may be an option to manage some of the culls resulting from the sorting of the fruits and vegetables. Giving culls to a food bank may be an option and the Good Samaritan Law will protect the donating company. However, since fruit and vegetables are perishable, not all of the culls can be utilized by this method. The farmer should stay in contact with the local food bank coordinator to inform them of harvest dates and what may be available, as well as to determine whether anyone would be allowed in the packing house and whether bins of culls would be available for further off-site culling and packaging for distribution to other food banks. The coordinator would need to provide a means to safely transport the culls to a location for further processing if needed, and the remaining culls would have to be disposed of using another method listed in this document.<br>
                     
                    <b>5)Compost fruit and vegetable culls</b><br>
                    Culls used in the composting process would either be transferred in a truck to the composting facility or mechanically transported if the compost facility is on-site. The culls would be mixed in proper ratios with other organic materials as recommended by composting professionals to produce compost suitable for reincorporation into fields or for selling. Georgia has a set of composting guidelines and regulations that should be referenced to ensure proper environmental protection and to obtain information on the final management of the compost product.<br>
                    
                    
                    <b>5)Process fruit and vegetable culls to separate the juice from the pulp<br></b>
                    The method of separating the fruit and vegetable culls into juice and pulp is accomplished by using a press. Typical systems are screw presses that can effectively separate the juice from the pulp. After separation, each fraction has its benefits for different reasons and purposes. If the culls are of good food quality they can be used as juices in food applications based on available markets. The pulp can also potentially be used as a component of foods. For those culls that are not of human food quality, the separated pulp can be used as one component of compost or animal food. (If the pulp is used for animal feed, check with an animal scientist or veterinarian prior to feeding.)The pulp can also be used as a soil amendment or as one component of a composting process. The juice can also be used as a feedstock for ethanol production or anaerobic digestion processes. For either process, there should be a market for the final products, ethanol or methane.<br><br><br><br>

				<a data-lightbox-gallery="portfolio-gallery"><img src="static/images/f1.jpg" alt="portfolio img"></a><h2 style="color: black">Worried About Left fishes?</h2> <p style="text-align: left;">The world wastes around 50 million tonnes of seafood every year.
                    Seafood waste management has been one of the problems having the greatest
                    impact on the environment. Fish farming detrimental effects on the marine
                    environment, in particular, have become an issue of public concern.<br>
                   <b>In Medicines<br></b>
                    Animal skin has long been used in the treatment of burns all around the world, but in
                    Brazil, their three skin banks only meet one percent of the national demand. To address
                    the issue, a doctor in the seaside town of Fortaleza is trialing the use of fish skins to treat
                    burn wounds. Enter the humble tilapia, a fish that’s widely farmed in Brazil and whose
                    skin, until now, was considered trash. The study of the fish skin revealed it is high in
                    collagen and has a similar moisture content to human skin. Sterilized skin strips are
                    applied to second- and third-degree burns and, unlike gauze bandages, actually, stay
                    on. The tilapia treatment has reduced pain and sped up wound healing. Australia has
                    over 5,000 known species of fish, with at least one new species being described every
                    month.<br>
                    
                    <b>Biodiesel/biogas<br></b>
                    Biodiesel fuel, acquired from the oils and fats of vegetables and animals, is a
                    substitute for, or an additive to, diesel fuel derived from petroleum (Alcantara et al. ,
                    2000). However, during the early 1980s, engine tests showed that the combustion of
                    vegetable oils caused durability problems related to incomplete combustion such as
                    nozzle coking, engine deposits, ring sticking, and crankcase lubricant contamination
                    (Dunn &amp; Bagby, 2000). Furthermore, the higher viscosity of vegetable oils compared
                    with diesel fuel caused excessive carbon deposition and thickening of lubricating oil
                    and was largely responsible for the problems encountered in using vegetable oils as
                    a diesel fuel especially in relatively cold areas and during cold seasons (Clark et al. ,
                    1983).<br>
                    The obtained oil was found to have suitable properties for use in diesel engines,
                    such as almost identical higher heating value (10 700 kcal kg−1) and density (at
                    15 °C, 0.87 g cm−3), lower flash and pour points (37 and −16 °C, respectively)
                    
                    compared with commercial diesel fuel, no production of sulfur oxides, lowered or no
                    soot, polyaromatic and carbon dioxide emissions. These properties suggested that
                    the obtained oil had better properties than methyl‐esterified vegetable oil waste and
                    was suitable for diesel engines, especially in low‐temperature areas.<br>
                   <b>Food industry/cosmetics<br></b>
                    The recovery of chemical components from seafood waste materials, which can be
                    used in other segments of the food industry, is a promising area of research and
                    development for the utilization of seafood by‐products. Researchers have shown
                    that a number of useful compounds can be isolated from seafood waste including
                    enzymes, gelatin and proteins that have antimicrobial and antitumor capabilities.
                    Chitosan, produced from shrimp and crab shell, has shown a wide range of
                    applications from the cosmetic to pharmaceutical industries.<br>
                    The shrimp waste consisted of 71.4% head and 28.6% shell (Meyers, 1986). This
                    waste contains useful components such as protein, lipid, and astaxanthin pigment,
                    thus making the commercial shrimp waste an attractive material for extraction of the
                    above‐mentioned components in order to utilize them in seafood products occurred.
                    The results indicated that SHPH could suppress dehydration-induced denaturation of
                    myofibrillar protein by hydrated water stabilization, decreased Ca‐ATPase
                    inactivation and increased monolayer sorbed water and multilayer sorbed water of
                    myofibrillar. Therefore, SPH can be used as a natural food additive to suppress the
                    denaturation of myofibrillar protein and maintain moisture in intermediate moisture.<br>
                    
                    Proteases are the most important group of industrial enzymes used in the world and
                    find several applications in the food industry (Garcia‐Carreño et al. , 1994).
                    Proteases are mainly derived from plant, animal, and microbial sources, whereas
                    their counterparts derived from marine and other aquatic sources had not been
                    extensively used (Haard &amp; Simpson, 1994). Meat toughness, often attributed to two
                    
                    factors, myofibrillar and background toughness and toughness, is the most important
                    factor affecting consumer assessment of beef palatability (Savell et al. , 1987, 1989;
                    Smith et al. , 1987). Aoki et al. (2004) partially purified proteases from Northern
                    shrimp Pandalus Borealis, in order to tenderize the beef. Surimi is mechanically
                    deboned, water washed, minced fish meat with cryoprotectants. Frozen storage of
                    surimi reduces the gel‐forming ability
                    The extraction of milk‐clotting enzymes from fish stomach mucosa for cheese
                    manufacture would provide an inexpensive alternative to rennet substitutes for
                    domestic use or to export to cheese‐producing nations and would become a new
                    food‐related industry.<br>
