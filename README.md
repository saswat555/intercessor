Intercessor

Intercessor is a smart warehouse management tool that uses machine learning to reduce the wastage of perishable goods. The main goal is to make a system that can forecast the upcoming sales for a warehouse and then use the same to restock according to the predicted sales. So this is the main idea behind the project.
This is an open-source project, so you are free to use the code and the tool as per your choice. To use the project, you can follow the basic code used in the whole system and customise it accoding to your choice and use case. The project is under development and there will be tons of updates upcoming, so stay tuned. Currently we are working on automating the variable for forecasting accorrding to the data. For the current system, it was done manually using R programming. The project has accuracy of about 97% which is quiet significant according to the dataset we have used.
The project uses ARIMA model, which is one of the popular machine learning model for time-series forecasting.
